## ⚠️ Important Warning Regarding the Use of Scrapers

Please be advised that the scraping scripts included in this repository have the potential to make a high volume of requests to targeted websites. It is crucial to understand that excessive request rates can inadvertently resemble a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. Such unintended heavy traffic can cause significant issues for the website servers and may be perceived as malicious activity.

**Use at Your Own Risk:** Users of these scripts should exercise **caution and responsibility**. It is strongly recommended to implement a reasonable delay between requests to mitigate the risk of overloading the servers. This not only helps in maintaining ethical scraping practices but also aligns with the fair use policies of most websites.

Remember, responsible use of scraping tools is essential. Misuse of these scripts could lead to your IP being blocked by the website, legal repercussions, or other unintended consequences. Always prioritize the integrity and availability of the target websites while using these tools.
